 - Converted bit of code from jupyter notebook into code
 - Trimmed away all non-numeric data to build a quick model to see how it performs
 - I plan to then go back and incorporate the non-numeric data through one-hot matricies and other means later
 - However, I need to make a one-hot method to classify the loan_status values, so I'll need to do that work anyway...
 - Made some progress on getting the unique values in the loan_status column so that they can be used to make a one-hot matrix.
